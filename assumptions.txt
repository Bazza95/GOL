Assumptions/Design:
It was requested the GET requests from the CLI application are in the form '/room/x/y'. I took the approach that the frontend doesn't need to store the current location.
The CLI application and associated api calls were designed with the approach that the backend server is the information expert.
Calls from the frontend send the minimal amount of data such that the backend can process requests.
Application data such as the player score, lives remaining and current position is stored in the backend.

Feedback:
Took around 3-4hours of productive time, due to work and personal interruptions.
Unusual that a code test involve two separate apps, but both use node, so very manageable in the end.
It would have been really useful if a method of submission had have been specified.
